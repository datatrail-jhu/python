# Intro to Python

Python is a popular programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. 

Python is supported by multiple libraries that support data science tasks:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computing with multidimensional arrays.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and analysis with data frames.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization.

## Main Differences between R and Python

The main difference between Python and R is that Python is a general-purpose programming language, while R is a statistical programming language. This means that Python is good at multiple things and can do most things, whereas R is very good at statistical analysis, but not as good at other things as Python.

You can use Jupyter Notebooks to generate reports and share them with others. Jupyter Notebooks are an open source web application for easily sharing documents that contain your live Python code, equations, visualizations and data science explanations. 

Python is particularly suited for large scale machine learning and deep learning with libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

## Python Syntax for R Users

Most important difference in syntax is 0-based indexing for Python and 1-based indexing for R. This means that in R, indexing starts with 1 and in Python, indexing starts with 0. Coming from R, this means you have to subtract your "R indexes" by 1 to get the correct index in Python.

Other major differences in Python:

### Whitespace

Important in Python. In R, expressions are grouped into a code block with `{}`. In Python, expressions are grouped by indentation level. 

For example, in R, an if statement looks like:


```r
x <- 1

if (x > 0) {
    print("x is positive")
} else {
    print("x is negative")
}
```

```
## [1] "x is positive"
```

In Python, the equivalent if statement looks like:


```python
x = 1

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

```
## x is positive
```


### Data Structures

There are 4 different data storage formats, or data structures, in Python: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

#### Lists

Python lists are created using brackets `[]`. You can add elements to the list through the `append()` method.


```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
x.append(4) # add 4 to the end of list

print("x is", x)
```

```
## x is [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

```python
#> x is [1, 2, 3, 4]
```


You can index into lists with integers using brackets `[]`, but note that indexing is 0-based.


```python
x = [1, 2, 3]

x[0]
```

```
## 1
```

```python
#> 1
x[1]
```

```
## 2
```

```python
#> 2
x[2]
```

```
## 3
```

```python
#> 3
```


Negative numbers count from the end of the list.


```python
x = [1, 2, 3]

x[-1]
```

```
## 3
```

```python
#> 3
x[-2]
```

```
## 2
```

```python
#> 2
x[-3]
```

```
## 1
```

```python
#> 1
```

You can slice ranges of lists using the : inside brackets. Note that the slice syntax is not inclusive of the end of the slice range.


```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x[0:2] # get items at index positions 0, 1
```

```
## [1, 2]
```

```python
#> [1, 2]
x[1:]  # get items from index position 1 to the end
```

```
## [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

```python
#> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
x[:-2] # get items from beginning up to the 2nd to last.
```

```
## [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

```python
#> [1, 2, 3, 4]
x[:]   # get all the items
```

```
## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

```python
#> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```


#### Tuples

Tuples behave like lists, but are constructued using `()`, instead of `[]`. 


```python
x = (1, 2) # tuple of length 2
type(x)
```

```
## <class 'tuple'>
```

```python
#> <class 'tuple'>
len(x)
```

```
## 2
```

```python
#> 2
x
```

```
## (1, 2)
```

```python
#> (1, 2)

x = (1,) # tuple of length 1
type(x)
```

```
## <class 'tuple'>
```

```python
#> <class 'tuple'>
len(x)
```

```
## 1
```

```python
#> 1
x
```

```
## (1,)
```

```python
#> (1,)

x = 1, 2 # also a tuple
type(x)
```

```
## <class 'tuple'>
```

```python
#> <class 'tuple'>
len(x)
```

```
## 2
```

```python
#> 2

x = 1, # beware a single trailing comma! This is a tuple!
type(x)
```

```
## <class 'tuple'>
```

```python
#> <class 'tuple'>
len(x)
```

```
## 1
```

```python
#> 1
```

#### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are data structures where you can retrieve items by name. They can be created using syntax like {key: value}.


```python
d = {"key1": 1,
     "key2": 2}

d["key1"] 
```

```
## 1
```

```python
#> 1
d["key3"] = 3
d 
```

```
## {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
```

```python
#> {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
```

#### Sets 

Sets are used to track unique items, and can be constructed using `{val1, val2}`.


```python
s = {1, 2, 3}

type(s)
```

```
## <class 'set'>
```

```python
#> <class 'set'>
s
```

```
## {1, 2, 3}
```

```python
#> {1, 2, 3}
```

### Iteration with for loops
 
The `for` statement in Python is similar to the `for` loop in R. It can be used to iterate over any kind of data structure.


```python
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
  print(x)
```

```
## 1
## 2
## 3
```

```python
#> 1
#> 2
#> 3
```

### Functions

Python functions are defined with the `def` statement. The syntax for specifying function arguments and default values is very similar to R.


```python
def my_function(name = "World"):
  print("Hello", name)

my_function()
```

```
## Hello World
```

```python
#> Hello World
my_function("Friend")
```

```
## Hello Friend
```

```python
#> Hello Friend
```

The equivalent R code would be


```r
my_function <- function(name = "World") {
  cat("Hello", name, "\n")
}

my_function()
```

```
## Hello World
```

```r
#> Hello World
my_function("Friend")
```

```
## Hello Friend
```

```r
#> Hello Friend
```


### Classes and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

In R, the most widely used unit of composition for code is functions, and in Python, it is classes. Classes are how you organize and find methods in Python. This approach to code composition is called object oriented programming (OOP). Let's dive in the details of OOP.

An object is any entity that you want to store and process data about. Each object is an instance of a class in the computer's memory. A class is a template for creating objects. Creating an object from a class is called instantiation. It has properties and methods (functions for the class). 

For example, we could have a class called Person. The properties of this class are what describe this Person class:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `gender`
- `date_of_birth`
- `occupation`


The methods of this class are the functions for this Person class:

- `walk()`
- `run()`
- `sleep()`
- `eat()`


Here is a simple Person class for demonstration purposes.


```python
class Person:
  pass # `pass` means do nothing.

Person
```

```
## <class '__main__.Person'>
```

```python
#> <class '__main__.Person'>
type(Person)
```

```
## <class 'type'>
```

```python
#> <class 'type'>

instance = Person()
instance
```

```
## <__main__.Person object at 0x10e0f5ed0>
```

```python
#> <__main__.Person object at 0x102ba75e0>
type(instance)
```

```
## <class '__main__.Person'>
```

```python
#> <class '__main__.Person'>
```

Like the `def` statement, the `class` statement is used to create a Python class. First note the strong naming convention, classes are typically CamelCase, and functions are typically snake_case. After defining Person, you can interact with it, and see that it has type 'type'. Calling `instance = Person()` creates a new object instance of the class, which has type `Person` (ignore the __main__. prefix for now). 


### Importing modules

In R, authors can bundle their code into R packages, and R users can access objects from R packages via `library()` or `::`. In Python, authors bundle code into modules, and users access modules using `import`.


```python
import numpy
```

Once loaded, you can access symbols from the module using `.`, which is equivalent to `::` in R.


```python
numpy.abs(-1)
```

```
## 1
```

There is special syntax for conveniently bounding a module to a symbol upon importing.


```python
import numpy        # import
import numpy as np  # import and bind to a custom symbol `np`

from numpy import abs # import only `numpy.abs`
from numpy import abs as abs2 # import only `numpy.abs`, bind it to `abs2`
```
